**Project Description:**

Given the growing trend of credit card usage, there exists a tremendous number of fraud activities hidden behind normal transactions. Therefore, in this project, we want to analyze what factors can help us detect credit card fraud transactions. In addition, we want to build a classifier to successfully detect fraud transactions from normal transactions. 

# Dataset
